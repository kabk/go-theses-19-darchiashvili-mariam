            Today we are living in the world where fear and doubt are being condemned to the ever-lasting flight down the void. Regarded as concepts of weakness and futility and opposed by the constantly enhancing and inflated concept of positive-thinking and “gratefulness”, fear and doubt became even more shameful to experience than they used to be throughout the history. This becomes a reason for us to start denouncing such crucial parts of our lives as non-important ones or as those that are reinforcing fears and insecurities in favour of artificial cover made of all that successful compensating and striving. I see such escapism as an eminently important issue that can have poor fallout for our civilisation’s present and thus - future. This is why I am interested in the topic of nocturnal culture and how dark aesthetic and in general exposure to fear and dark colors, especially the black image,  can influence our cognition and evolution. Most importantly, it is not just fear playing a role in this game, but everything that builds up on the basis of it as well, such as Nocturnus, Silence and ambiguity. All of these, both as separate entities and as cultures derived from them are far from being discussed as something more than experiments and challenges, whilst in reality they are some of the best tools we can use for building up our consciousness and fertilising soil for our advancement. I strongly believe that such strategy, of facing Nocturnus as it is and relishing the beauty of fear, can evoke higher modes of both self and general analysis and bring out the natural curiosity in humans that now is unfortunately put into lethargic sleep.
            	I am used to such mode of thought since childhood, being exposed to a large library at home. There was virtually no restriction on which work would end up in my hands and having early access to late 19th century Russian literature along with ancient greek history and myths, books of Edgar Allan Poe and so on. I discovered that in that dark room filled with not-fully painted, mostly tragic and/or questionable stories that were so silent, ambiguous and bigger than me, my consciousness was at most of it’s work capacities and whilst leaving that room it could be physically felt that the brain was burning. Burning because it was running after something it couldn’t understand at first, surrounded by lexemes out of its’ knowledge that was small and dark. It felt magical, and only later I found out that “only where there is heat is there distinction between past and future” and lessons learnt. This is why I seek to re-invigorate a sense of wonder, uncertainty and mystery in life by implementing and emphasising the Nocturnus and fears of unknown. And with such aim this paper will be looking into history of how and if various parts of Nocturnal Culture were influencing human evolution, if they had an effect on individuals or masses, both positive and negative, in order to find proving arguments that can be served to our society which is drowning in “positive living bullet journals” and “books of everyday gratefulness” instead of simply turning of the lights and thinking.
            It should probably also be admitted that to the some readers of this paper the attitude which shines through the first sentences might already feel alerting and confusing but I will allow myself such a privilege of provoking disagreement amongst them as disagreement is the most fertile soil for analysis. And it should be, since the problematic of today that is concealed in the loss of genuineness and almost dogmatic creation of artificial bubbles of joy is hugely important and dangerous for our potential as human beings.
            Most of humanity tends to forget one simple verity - fear is not one of our fundamental emotions for the reason of making us feel like little cubs lost in the dangerous jungles with no hope and mom around. Fear is built into us for the reason of evolution, as it is meant to be one of the main triggers for human development and survival. We fear the dark? We light fire. We think we light fire to get warmer? That is true as well, as we can not check what was happening in the minds of our predecessors. But behind that - still hides the fundamental and subconscious fear of death.  And it can be said that this is brilliant and beautiful how opposition of contradictories paves the road for our benefit. Denouncing it now along with anything that evokes or reminds of it is a path to unfortunate regress of our minds. And the most painful fact in this issue is that whilst declining the concept of fear we are doing it out of fear of fear.

            In the world of human race being very close to Yevgeny Zamyatin’s “We”, majority of our mainstream public is becoming more than simply atrophied. As if produced in the same capsule, large part of our population has an inherited loss of curiosity or better to say - adventure. Everyone is so unique and safe that everybody is the same and threatened without realising it and this is critical in terms of our further progress. It has nowhere to go and this is why we need this comeback to the “whole” to the “one”, to the night. Just as seen in example of Dr. Faust, such path (path of our mainstream culture, not the one of Faust) is too narrow and leads us to the end of knowledge way too fast, and in a way just as Faust, we long for nature, happiness and higher universe expecting it to be bright. We summon illusions that are soon to leave us unsatisfied. Whilst what needs to happen - is to look to your side, away from the empty path, and inquire into the small lights far in the darkness of woods around you.
            Some may argue back that we are not shying away from unknown as this is what drives our highly progressive sciences. But as much as we lost our fear of knowledge in the bright sterile scientific labs, we have to accept that testing new chemical solutions or trying to clone Dolly in the dark would all of the sudden become much eerier. As much as we seek to convince others and ourselves that fear and negativity do not exist anymore and are just illusions of past - there is still nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown. He wants to see what is reaching towards him and to be able to recognise, or at least clarify it. “Even clothes give insufficient security: it is easy to tear them and pierce through to the naked, smooth, defenceless flesh of the victim.”
            Fear and darkness exist. Let’s cross it here. We leave in the society where everyone can be what they want, the kindest, brightest, most positive bravest self, yet fear is still there. In the way we move on the streets, restaurants, busses and trains, in the way we stand next to each other. Even then, when we are able to observe and inspect strangers closely - we still avoid actual contact as much as we can. And the reason why our attempts at eliminating fear and suspense from our society are perilous is hidden already in this example.  “The only way to avoid fear of touch for man is the crowd. “The crowd he needs is the dense crowd, in which body pressed to body; a crowd, too, whose psychical constitution is also dense, or compact, so that he no longer notices who it is that presses against him.” And such scenario (from a certain perspective) portraits the stripping down of identity that highly reminds of the highly dystopian future that this way will be awaiting us in the end.
