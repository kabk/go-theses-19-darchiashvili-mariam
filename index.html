            A WILD MAN

            Today we are living in the world where fear and doubt are being condemned to the ever-lasting flight down the void. Regarded as concepts of weakness and futility and opposed by the constantly enhancing and inflated concept of positive-thinking and “gratefulness”, fear and doubt became even more shameful to experience than they used to be throughout the history. This becomes a reason for us to start denouncing such crucial parts of our lives as non-important ones or as those that are reinforcing fears and insecurities in favour of artificial cover made of all that successful compensating and striving. I see such escapism as an eminently important issue that can have poor fallout for our civilisation’s present and thus - future. This is why I am interested in the topic of nocturnal culture and how dark aesthetic and in general acceptance and exposure to fear and dark colors, especially the black image,  can influence our cognition and evolution. Most importantly, it is not just fear playing a role in this game, but everything that builds up on the basis of it as well, such as Nocturnus, Silence and ambiguity. All of the above, both as separate entities and as cultures derived from them are far from being discussed as something more than experiments and challenges, whilst in reality they are some of the best tools we can use for building up our consciousness and fertilising soil for our advancement. Things as “subcultural” or “unreal” as Bram Stoker’s Dracula and or Nocturnal Animals by Tom Ford can already pave a way for constructing an understanding of our race. I strongly believe that such strategy, of facing Nocturnus as it is and relishing the beauty of fear, can evoke higher modes of both self and general analysis and bring out the natural curiosity in humans that now is unfortunately put into lethargic sleep. <br><br>
          	I am used to such mode of thought since childhood, being exposed to a large library at home. There was virtually no restriction on which work would end up in my hands and having early access to late 19th century Russian literature along with ancient greek history and myths, books of Edgar Allan Poe and so on. I discovered that in that dark room filled with not-fully painted, mostly tragic and/or questionable stories that were so silent, ambiguous and bigger than me, my consciousness was at most of it’s work capacities and whilst leaving that room it could be physically felt that the brain was burning. Burning because it was running after something it couldn’t understand at first, surrounded by lexemes out of its’ knowledge. Knowledge that was small and dark. It felt magical, and only later I found out that “only where there is heat is there distinction between past and future” and lessons learnt. This is why I seek to re-invigorate a sense of wonder, uncertainty and mystery in life by implementing and emphasising the Nocturnus and fears of unknown. And with such aim this paper will be looking into history of how and if various parts of Nocturnal Culture were influencing human evolution, if they had an effect on individuals or masses, both positive and negative, in order to find proving arguments that can be served to our society which is drowning in “positive living bullet journals” and “books of everyday gratefulness” instead of simply turning of the lights and thinking. <br><br>
          It should probably also be admitted that to some readers of this paper the attitude which shines through the first sentences might already feel alerting and confusing but I will allow myself such a privilege of provoking disagreement amongst them as disagreement is the most fertile soil for analysis. And it should be, since the problematic of today that is concealed in the loss of genuineness and almost dogmatic creation of artificial bubbles of joy is hugely important and dangerous for our potential as human beings. <br><br>
          Most of humanity tends to forget one simple verity - fear is not one of our fundamental emotions for the reason of making us feel like little cubs lost in the dangerous jungles with no hope and mom around. Fear is built into us for the reason of evolution, as it is meant to be one of the main triggers for human development and survival. We fear the dark? We light fire. We think we light fire to get warmer? That is true as well, as we can not check what was happening in the minds of our predecessors. But behind that - still hides the fundamental and subconscious fear of death.  And it can be said that this is brilliant and beautiful how opposition of contradictories paves the road for our benefit. Denouncing it now along with anything that evokes or reminds of it is a path to unfortunate regress of our minds. And the most painful fact in this issue is that whilst declining the concept of fear we are doing it out of fear of fear. <br><br>
          In the world of human race being very close to Yevgeny Zamyatin’s “We”, majority of our mainstream public is becoming more than simply atrophied. As if produced in the same capsule, a large part of our population has an inherited loss of curiosity or better to say - adventure. This can also be seen in a way of our “acceptance” of nocturnal culture, which does not happen and become popular unless it is diminished to the PG-13 rating and wrapped in a creative yet standard packaging of predictability. Everyone is so unique and safe that everybody is the same and threatened without realising it and this is critical in terms of our further progress. It has nowhere to go and this is why we need this comeback to the “whole” to the “one”, to the night. Just as seen in example of Dr. Faust, such path (path of our mainstream culture, not the one of Faust) is too narrow and leads us to the end of knowledge way too fast, and in a way just as Faust, we long for nature, happiness and higher universe expecting it to be bright. We summon illusions that are soon to leave us unsatisfied. Whilst what needs to happen - is to look to your side, away from the empty path leading into nowhere, and inquire into the small lights far in the darkness of woods around you. <br><br>
          Some may argue back that we are not shying away from unknown as this is what drives our highly progressive sciences. But as much as we lost our fear of knowledge in the bright sterile scientific labs, we have to accept that testing new chemical solutions or trying to clone Dolly in the darkness of the less lit space that is not equipped with plans B, C, D etc..  would all of the sudden become much eerier. As much as we seek to convince others and ourselves that fear and negativity do not exist anymore and are just illusions of past and naive - there is still nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown. He wants to see what is reaching towards him and to be able to recognise, or at least clarify it. “Even clothes give insufficient security: it is easy to tear them and pierce through to the naked, smooth, defenceless flesh of the victim.”<br><br>
          Fear and darkness exist. Let’s cross it here. We live in society where everyone can be what they want, the kindest, brightest, most positive bravest self, yet fear is still there. In the way we move on the streets, restaurants, busses and trains, in the way we stand next to each other. Even then, when we are able to observe and inspect strangers closely - we still avoid actual physical contact with any of them as much as we can. And the reason why our attempts at eliminating fear and suspense from our society are perilous is hidden already in this example.  “The only way to avoid fear of touch for man is the crowd. “The crowd he needs is the dense crowd, in which body pressed to body; a crowd, too, whose psychical constitution is also dense, or compact, so that he no longer notices who it is that presses against him.” And such scenario (from a certain perspective) portraits the stripping down of identity that highly reminds of the highly dystopian future that this way will be awaiting us in the end. Think of it this way, facing night and staying alone with yourself in the darkness when nothing else entertains you enough to distract from yourself is as uncomfortable as standing in an elevator with a single stranger.  We can even say that a not so recent movie “Devil” (a mystic thriller about 5 stranger getting stuck in an elevator) is not so much about the Devil himself deciding to visit these 5 random people, but them facing their own Egos, portrayed with an image of Devil and triggered by a prolonged seclusion in a narrow singular space. <br><br>

        <div class="endquote">  “I am aware of myself. And, of course, the only things that are aware of themselves and conscious of their individuality are irritated eyes, cut fingers, sore teeth. A healthy eye, finger, tooth might as well not even be there. Isn't it clear that individual consciousness is just sickness?”

            THE GOOD UGLINESS OF NATURE

            In order to begin discussing relevance and materiality of Nocturnus we should first pose it in front of us as philosopher’s stone; count its angles, faces and reflections. Being translated from latin as “of the night” it gives us a big spectre of elements to bring to discussion at this table, moreover we have already started with one of them in the previous chapter. Fear is the basis of it all and having touched the fundament of the thesis we can now slowly come back to its main floorpan - night. Thus, further in this paper Nocturnus and fear will be inseparable due to their nature. Now it’s time to talk about the wild man, the wild times and the wild material. <br><br>
            As a prologue to this and following chapter we must say that avoiding the lure of pure psychological ideation and analysis of fear, this thesis corroborates the criticism towards specific trends existing in our era that would rather focus on the individual dimension of fear, thus missing its social aspects. Fear can not and must not ever be reduced to its emotional actuality, on the contrary, it must rather be regarded by anthropologists as the prime mover of rational cognition in treacherous or fatal conditions. <br><br>
            Night and love for it (also known as nyctophilia) are a complex matter, especially in our daylight-based civilisation. If we start with Nyctophilia itself, based on the latin origins of “Nycto” and “Philia” we can safely state that it is literally love for the darkness and night. But moreover (also from a personal perspective of a nyctophiliac myself) it is also a feeling of one’s belong in the night. As a side-effect people with nyctophilia tend to have attraction to darkness, cold rainy days and silence as well. And on top of that it also is utterly crucial to articulate the fact that people who love darkness, on the contrary to the common belief and stereotypes, do not necessarily become Gothic or only watch horror movies with a heavy metal music as their soundtrack for life. I believe that what defines the love for darkness is precisely the ability to discover, distinguish and treasure it even within the light of colourful lamps during the day, thus portraying a somewhat inevitability of its’ presence in a nyctophiliacs’ life that may have both positive or negative effects on such people. A person, defining himself this way is becoming a microscopic, enhanced case study for how Nocturnus and Fear influence our lives. <br><br>
            However, with all that said, almost no-one can argue against the fact that at the moment we simply biologically can not live only during the night as much as some of us may wish that. On top of that majority will argue that we might not have survived as biological species if we would only function at night in the first steps of humanity. As one of the simplest arguments to that can be the fact that mornings, with the exposure to light, let our SCN send signals to hike the temperature of our body and produce hormones such as cortisol, as well as SCN also responds to sunlight with postponing the release of other hormones such as melatonin, which stays up all night also promoting sleep and is produced as our eyes signal the SCN that we are surrounded by darkness. As simple and argumentative as it is we still can speculate that nocturnal life-style could still have been possible for us if certain settings of human development have been different. Our planet is already inhabited by perfect examples of this being possible with a whole list of nocturnal creatures that either stayed in the deep see since Palaeozoic Era or evolved this way over centuries. These animals generally have highly developed senses of hearing, smell, and specially adapted eyesight which help creatures like the Helicoverpa zea moths avoid predators. However, what’s most important is if in our well-established world there is still an opportunity for change? And yes, there is. We live in an era where massive numbers of species - from feral dogs and deers, to East African sea cows - have all made a conversion from flexible or diurnal lifestyles to nocturnal ones. Where mammals have a possibility to function nocturnally, and where they are continuously ringed by humanity, they fairly eagerly begin sleeping/going underground for the period of the day. This suggests that we can argue that no statements are solid as human species could have also adapted and evolved differently throughout history if the circumstances would be different around us. Putting it radically, it might have been, that if the local setting of the millions of years back would turn us into nocturnal creatures - we wouldn’t be facing problematics that I’m trying to approach in this thesis. <br><br>
            However, facing reality, we have to thank evolution for tying us to the daylight as it gave us soil, engine and drive for development. Part of which is fear. “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown” - so from an evolutionary viewpoint, the fear response is an absolutely necessary part of our mental system. It is the way we recognise and avoid threats. “Since fear helps protect you it is therefore adaptive, functional, and necessary.” Linking deeply to the experience of uncertainty—it makes us anticipate that we might feel pain/hunger or anything threatening to us soon, and it orients us to escape and increase our distance from the feared stimulus. This is also why it is highly amusing to watch the ideology of positive living strive in stating that fear is just a construction that does not exist, as what happens in reality - they try to increase distance from the very same “feared stimulus”. <br><br>
            Since that response is tied in with natural selection, certain cues—such as snake or cat-eye patterns, spider-like objects, and Nocturnus (where the snakes, panthers, and spiders are found)—more easily invoke that emotion. This is the result of generation upon generation of early humans reacting to and subsequently preparing for dangers such as these. That's why many ancient threats— weather threats, uncontrolled fire, spiders, snakes, predators, and night—are having higher chances to instigate a negative response, even in small children, rather than contemporary threats like cars, nuclear or chemical weapons, or mortars do. Here is the moment where the side opposing me can have its fare share of argumentativeness. Although, the question on that bank of barricades becomes is then our survival instinct failing us? One may argue - Unfortunately, what did its; job for us as cave people doesn’t as matter of course function the same in the 21st century due to the enlarged intricacy of life that has evolved, humankind became more civilised and as technological advancements have changed our individual, social, and work lives thus shifting the notion of survival dramatically nowadays. I’ve seen some people believe that  our existence is no longer about staying alive by fighting or overcoming challenges such as critical threats, we no longer have to fear to have a roof over our heads as a result of survival instinct and the same goes for the clothes on our back and food at the table. Their argument lies in these essentials not being changed over years, but becoming less urgent in comparison to the complex contemporary fears of today. The fight-or-flight reaction to threats, they say, is far too simplistic to effectively overcome many of those we are confronted with today. Unlike threats of the past, today’s are often neither immediate, foreseeable, or understandable, much less controllable. In fact, not only is this hard-wired response of fear often not effective, but it can be counterproductive to our survival. However, instead of confronting these statements by diminishing the role of the “modern unforeseeable threats” we have to say that the problematic of todays behaviour towards Nocturnus and fear is way to radical and segregative. It is simply unreasonable to fight against the instinctive, anthropological fears and saying “they are not relevant anymore compared to all the psychological struggles of today” because it is the same algorithm our brain operated millions of years ago for us to escape heavy rain and predators and today, for us not get under the car on a highway. We still have to survive the weather conditions, we still fear of being attacked by someones dogs, we still are scared of the night, be it a bat attacking you for the sake of fun or a criminal trying to still your TV. The cruciality of accepting the fears and Nocturnus lies in the fact that instead of stepping on the same trap now, we should rather learn from the experiences of people before us. Not on someones short-told story, but on someone’s book that is the history of humankind. <br><br>
            Historically the threat was defined as the object of fear, so obviously the problem was in these very objects, such as hunger, death and illness, or today it can be loss of job, being homeless or a fear of tsunami. However, the utter hitch of today is, as described by Frank Furedi in his article on “The only thing we have to fear is the ‘culture of fear’ itself”, in the fact that today many see the act of fearing as a threat in itself, which brought us to this positivistic ice cube that now melts like arctic ice caps, threatening our existence. Consider the debate about the fear of crime. Nowadays fear of crime is seen as a serious problem that is to extent distinct from real acts of crime. A Garland observes: “Fear of crime has come to be regarded as a problem in and of itself, quite distinct from actual crime and victimisation, and distinctive policies have been developed that aim to reduce fear levels, rather than reduce crime”. It looks like fear of crime now is “recognised as a more widespread problem than the crime itself”. <br><br>
            According to Elias Canetti, the paranoiac type of ruler may be defined as one who uses every means to keep danger away from his person. Instead of challenging and confronting it and abiding the issue of a fight which might go against him, he seeks y circumspection and cunning to block its approach to him. He creates empty space all around him which he can survey, and he observes and assesses every sign of approaching danger. And this is exactly what our society might be facing in a not so distant future - becoming paranoid and surrounded by emptiness with no meaning. We became so scared of being scared, that we ring ourselves with this enormous space filled with radical positivism that is empty in itself and blindfolding. And we do it to such extent that our mainstream development is freezing itself in time, people start saying that there is nothing left to achieve but no-one yet have noticed that indeed, the King is naked.

            Now, as the title of this thesis suggests, we are not here to discuss only fear and night, but also to see how all of the things they are associated with function and coexist. Partly we need this to show the diverse and far-spread reach of the topic within the texture of our existence, thus solidifying the arguments to come. <br><br>
            Night and Nocturnus have always been ever-present in the culture of humankind. Historically it has taken various positions in both music, visual arts and literature. Being embedded in our nature quite often it has been derived from emotion and high alertness, rather than reason of pure mind. It is indeed a constant π value of our reality and thus can show its’ head from most unexpected corners.The fundament for its’ strong connotations with everything gruesome, unknown and odd is no longer a secret for us. And yet, each example of our interpretation of Night in Art is a unique object, plus in this uniqueness hides the beauty of darkness and it’s openness for interpretation. Unlike sterile spaces with clear thoughts and messages, uncertainty and ambiguity of absence of light gives our cognition space for radical interpretation and metamorphosing along with evolvement.

            <span class="author">(Albert Giraud, “Pierrot lunaire: rondel bergamasques” (1884), in Otto Erich Hartleben’s translation)</span>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            This is an interesting example of such interpretation - the German translation of Albert Giraud’s “Pierrot lunaire: rondel bergamasques” (1884), which also seems to be better known in its’ German rather than French rendering. In 1892 Otto Erich Hartleben did a translation or the text that later became largely popular due to the work of Arnold Schoenberg composed in 1912. For his “Dreimal sieben Gedichte aus Albert Girauds ‘Pierrot Lunaire’”, Schoenberg chose 21 out of original 50 poems of Giraud and constructed a narrative of three parts of seven. Interestingly, the poem above “Nacht”, initiates a second part in which crime and violence dominate the general narrative. But what’s even more interesting for us is the fact that even although the original title of this piece was the “Papillons noirs”, Hartleben chose to call it night without having any seeming reference to it in the text nor in French or German. As noted by Ioannis Mylonopoulos in his work “Brutal are the children of the night!: Nocturnal violence in greek art”,  it is “the strong images captured in a few words that create an almost bloodcurdling atmosphere of the dangerous black night and justify the altered German title”.  This exemplifies the beauty that can be found in darkness and at the same time illustrates the connection between Nocturnus and Strength. <br><br>
            Other than that we can redirect our view towards Francisco Goya’s “Pinturas Negras” - one of the most powerful groups of paintings he wrote. Consisting of 14 paintings, originally done on the walls of his house outside Madrid by the end of his life, this series portray intense, haunting topics, and are illustrating the mode of thought that had inhabited Goya’s consciousness at the time, including both the fear of insanity and his austere outlook on humanity. What is so brilliant about this collection is the fact that the word ‘black’ is not necessarily reflecting the color of the paintings but rather goes one step further and represents the emotions that they embody - the disillusionment of Goya with the trajectory of both political and social progress of Spain in early 19th century. They are a perfect case study on how our cognition functions and how intertwined darkness is with it, if not defines it. One can not sense and analyse the texture of our reality through the sterile boxes. Our brains can not develop deductive skills if all the evidence is already put separately in a well-lit white box for you just to look - we should not just be observers, but searchers. Just as in the other work of Francesco Goya, the gravure “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters”, we first assume the obvious - when reason is at sleep we are surrounded by folly and ignorance (represented in owls and bats), but at the same time we can also interpret it as wisdom, death and rebirth (also symbols of owls and bats) coming to us in the most vulnerable position one can be in - sleep. Just as tarot cards can be read in two opposite meanings - the same obscurity belongs to nocturnus and our relation to it. <br><br>
            In general, night in Western paintings was and is a comparatively enticing and quiet neutral period of the day. It was found fruitful on many levels, both metaphorical and simply practical, such as giving artists a possibility to experiment with light, colors and shades. On the contrary to common beliefs - for artists night was far from being a representation of horror and fear, and its’ embracement was giving birth to its’ associations with both decapitation of Holofernes and with the Nativity of Jesus Christ.  Art scene is probably the only place for Night to be free of it’s prejudice and entitlement to horror and threat, as for the surreal world of artistic thought, grotesque and uncanny imagery or holy festive scenes could both be portrayed at day or at night (as seen also through the absurdist worlds of Hieronymus Bosch that were as disturbing and ominous under the bright blue sky).<br><br>
            And even if we move out of visual arts and frankly look through history of spirituality (which is one of the core aspects of Nocturnus and it’s importance not for no reason) and personifications of the Night itself - one can observe a truly interesting pattern.  For instance - Nut, originally a goddess of the night and later on of all the sky and heavens in Ancient Egyptian religion. She would swallow the sun in the evening and give birth to it once more in the morning, thus also giving the Night attributes of rebirth.  And on the other hand, we can look at  Nyx - greek female personification of the Night, a great cosmological figure of such powers that even Zeus feared her, according to Homer’s Illiad, Book XIV; who was the mother of multiple primordial powers, such as Death, Sleep, Nemesis, Old Age and most importantly Fates - the impersonation of our whole human existence.  <br><br>
            	It is sad to see how this reality transcended through Nocturnus along with its’ multiple representations in spiritual, cultural and more or less applied portraitures has become considered as irrelevant nowadays. In modernity, or, how we like to call our times, post-modernity, the only way for all of these to come back to us - is through the emancipatory role of modern and contemporary, to our generation, art or very particular writings that never reach broad public. Which is a positive direction, yet the path is so narrow and subtle that it still stays somber to see how aesthetics and concepts of darkness stay on the surface of mainstream populism and are embraced in common culture on through the safe lens of cartoonification, happy endings and epic adventures. One shall always bethink that Nocturnus is a representative of our thought process and by escaping the face of darkness we are escaping our own thought.  <br><br>
